* [Data Structure Visualizations](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/Algorithms.html). provides more free interactive demos for learning Algorithms.


### Advanced Resources that you may wish to consult as you prepare for CS 5800

* (Advanced) Introduction to Algorithms 4th edition, often used as a textbook for CS 5800 Algorithms course. Named "CLRS" for the initials of its 4 authors.
