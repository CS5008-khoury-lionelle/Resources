# Module 01 FAQ


## Do you have to use Khoury Github  / Github enterprise?
It is better if you use your personal github from github.com. We are using github classroom which integrates with github.com, and doesn't always play nicely with the enterprise github. 

## Do you have to use the Khoury servers to do the homework?
No! 

The khoury servers are the "Default", but we actually recommend getting everything working on your own system. There are often a lot of weird errors with the khoury servers that are out of our control. However, your own system also gets weird errors out of our control. As such, if your system goes down, we will direct you to ssh into the khoury servers and use VIM or emacs.  However, in general, you should get everything working on your personal computer, it will save you headaches later. 

## Where can i find the recordings of the live sessions (setup hints for various OS and applications?)
Click the files tab -> recordings

## What repo should I use?
A common mistake is creating an additional repo (like on your personal account). When you click on the github classroom link, it builds the repo for you - make sure the clone that repo! It is setup so you can keep it private, but the TAs have full access to it! If you setup a different repo, the TAs may not be able to grade it.
