# Technical Interview Questions

A collection of technical interview questions to be explored each module. 

## Module 1 - Github and Linux

### 1.1 Github

* Explain the difference between Git and GitHub. Further, explain the concept of version control and how it can help with collaboration in software development.

* How do you clone a github repository? How do you pull and push to a repository?

* You and your partner pull the same file from Github to make changes. You both change the same section of code. Your partner pushes their changes first, then you try to push. What is the result and how do you resolve this?

### 1.2 Linux

* What exactly is a terminal and why is it important?

* What does the command __ls__ stand for and what does it do? Sometimes files are hidden, how do you use __ls__ to view them?

* What does the command __rm__ do? Using __rm__ on a directory may cause an error if the directory contains files. How do we delete a directory and all of its contents?

* What are the three types of file permissions in Linux and how do you change them using __chmod__?

## Module 2 - C Programming

* What is the difference between a compiled and an interpreted language? Which one is better? Give an example of each.

* What is the difference between a static and a dynamic programming language? What are the pros and cons of each?

* What is the difference between stack and heap memory allocation and when would you use each?

* What is a pointer? What is the relationship between pointers and arrays in C?

* What is a memory leak and how do you identify it and prevent it?

* What is a segmentation fault? What tactics can you use to find where the segmentation fault occured?
